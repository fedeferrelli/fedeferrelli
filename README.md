FrontEnd Developer in the making.

It's never late to make a "leap" of carreer and life style: I'm also an economist with more than 10 years in the financial sector, mostly in corporate finance. But here I am, on my way into the tech world...

I'm curious, focused and love to learn, keep learning and learn some more.

:spaghetti: Fun fact:I make my own pasta twice a week and it's spectacular! :spaghetti:
